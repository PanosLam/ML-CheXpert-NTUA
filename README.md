# ML-CheXpert-NTUA

The PhD program at NTUA requires to succeed in a specific number of courses. Machine Learning is one of the courses (selected).
In the context of the ML course, we are summoned to form teams and work on some projects. 

Team consistency:
1. Angeliki Dimitriou (dimitriou.angelik@gmail.com) - PhD Candidate
2. Vaia Kontopoulou (vaiakontop@gmail.com) - PhD Candidate
3. Panagiotis Lamprakis (panoslam4@gmail.com) - PhD Candidate

We decided to work with the [CheXpert dataset](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) in the scope of this project. The limitation of the project is to use scikit-learn's libraries for the classification stage.
